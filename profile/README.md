> If you don't know what Project AIRI is, here's the introduction:
>
> Project AIRI aimed to build the ultimate virtual AI lives within the cyber spaces, we are currently targeting to re-create Neuro-sama.
>
> Funding? Startup?
>
> Currently, we have several parnership projects with other companies to build similar products, but I (@nekomeowww) primarily self sponsored those most contributed members of both @proj-airi and @moeru-ai, for supporting their work. I'd love have a opportunity to work on this project in long term without worrying the funding. If you are, and indeed got interested in this project, please contact me.

> Who are we?
>
> We are a group of currently non-funded talented people made up with computer scientists, experts in multi-modal fields, designers, product managers, and popular open source contributors who loves the goal of where we are heading now.
